            <p>Indian Institute Of Technology Bombay, being the most esteemed engineering institute of India, has seen many facets of students when it comes to academics.</p>
            <p>We surveyed the passing out batch to get a more thorough insight into students mentality towards the
              extracurriculars they have done here at the institute. We get to see many aspects and attitudes of students in general towards them.</p>
            <p>Here is an overview of the same.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Among the total responses, 3.273 responses out of 5 are affirmative that holding a Position of
                    Responsibility has benefited them.</li>
                <li>Majority of the correspondents responded that they developed their organizational skills, followed by technical, sport, cultural and others. Very few responded that they did not pick up any skill.</li>
                <li>Majority of the students are either politically unbiased or inclined towards left.</li>
