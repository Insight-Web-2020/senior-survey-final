            </h1>

            <p>Indian Institute Of Technology Bombay, being the most esteemed engineering institute of India, has seen many facets of students when it comes to academics.</p>
            <p>We surveyed the passing out batch to get a more thorough insight into students mentality towards their
                lifestyle here at the institute. We get to see many aspects and attitudes of students
                in general towards their lifestyle at IIT Bombay.</p>
            <p>Here is an overview of the same.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A total of 215 students filled the survey form and presented their views across a wide range of
                    questions ranging from General Lifestyle to Mental Health to Smoking Habits and many more.</li>
                <li>Around 36.28% of the students pegged their monthly expenditure between 1000 and 3000 Rupees,
                    while around 29% of the respondents spend over 5000 Rupees per month.</li>
                <li>Most of the students did not have any smoking habits, while a considerable (8.4%) number of
                    our responders admitted to being chain smokers, who smoked around a pack per day. Around
                    1-10th students admitted to smoking rarely(once in two-three weeks).</li>
            </ul>
